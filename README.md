This repository contains a few pathways to impact relevant to QURI's work. They are created using excalidraw.com (h/t tcelferact on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zHS4FJhByRjqsuH4o/the-best-software-for-every-need?commentId=zvfBBtLCvmTXtjgrj)). Criticisms, complaints and contributions are welcome.

Note that the forecasting and evaluations pathways are fairly detailed, but the rest are fairly under-developed.
